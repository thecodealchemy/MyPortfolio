    introduction: `
I am Aditya Kumar Singh, a software engineer based in Gurugram, India. I earned my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, where I built a strong foundation in analytical thinking, systems design, and practical problem-solving.

I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I focus on designing and implementing backend systems that prioritize scalability, reliability, and low-latency performance. I approach engineering end-to-end ‚Äî from clarifying requirements to delivering production-ready, observable services ‚Äî and I emphasize maintainability and testability.

My core interests include distributed systems, performance optimization, and developer tooling. I apply principled engineering to reduce operational complexity, improve observability, and enable faster iteration across teams and products. I also document technical decisions and share practical lessons to help others adopt better engineering practices.

Outside of work, I enjoy strength training, street photography, and writing technical notes that make systems-level concepts more accessible. I value collaborative problem-solving, mentorship, and opportunities to translate ideas into production-quality software.

For collaborations or to request a copy of my resume, contact me at adityaks.tech@gmail.com or view my CV [here](/ADITYA_KUMAR_SINGH.pdf).

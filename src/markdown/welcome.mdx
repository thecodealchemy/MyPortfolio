I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University 🐿️](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), driven by a *sincere passion* for **Software Engineering 💻.**

Software is built by humans. Unfortunately, humans make errors, <mark className="text-orange-yellow-crayola bg-transparent"><b>LOTS of ERRORS.</b></mark> Throughout human history, humans have learned to craft machines and tools to help us construct complex architecture. Inspired by this, I explore practical methodologies and tools to improve large-scale software systems' quality, reliability, and efficiency.

In my spare time, I focus on contributing to open-source projects, alongside working out 💪🏻, capturing street photography 📸, and writing tech content ✍🏻.

**Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding 👨🏻‍💻**
